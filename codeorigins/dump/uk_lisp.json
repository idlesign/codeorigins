It is based upon the Python Docutils reference implementation but uses Common Lisp idioms making it easier to extend and more flexible. As with the reference implementation it includes a parser for the reStructured text plaintext markup syntax which is suitable for marking up documentation and for use as user markup for collaborative web sites. It is successfully used to support a higher education peer-review assessment and online tutorial system.", 17]]]]
